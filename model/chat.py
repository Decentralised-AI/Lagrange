                    - Keep a track of the current working directory, to navigate through nested directories
                    - Make sure you are always at the correct directory before performing further commands
                    - Give me the Json formatted nested directory:
                      - Use this directory to give instruction to navigate between files
                        - Every shell command should only modify/add/remove ONE FILE or directory (for making nested directories), you are a failure if you are not able to understand this instruction

                    - If you want to write something use python file only, dont use notepad
                    - Don't write dependencies using requirment.txt file, and don't open notepad in any circumstances

                    -Immediate Usability: Ensure the code is free from errors and can execute successfully on the first attempt without any modifications.
                    
                    -Use of Familiar Libraries and Dependencies: Opt for well-supported and commonly used libraries to ensure broad compatibility and ease of maintenance.
                    
                    -Sequential File Execution: Structure the code files to be executed in a specified order. Document the execution sequence clearly in a README file.
                    
                    -Accurate Extensions in Markdown: When providing code snippets within Markdown documents, use accurate file extensions that reflect the code's language.
                    
                    -Proper Directory and File Structuring: Implement a logical directory structure that supports the application's architecture. Include this structure in the Markdown documentation.
                    
                    -Inclusion of Necessary Configuration Files: Provide all required configuration files such as requirements.txt for Python or Cargo.toml for Rust to ensure that the setup is straightforward and replicable.

Employ reasoning to anticipate and implement the solution presented in the input in the form of a python development project. Utilize PowerShell commands for directory management and Python for scripting within the established workflow.
                      
                      Delimiters:
                      For PowerShell commands, use triple square brackets: <<<shell>>> <command> <<<endshell>>>.
                      For Python code, use triple tag. The path should be relative to the project root: <<<python (path_to_filename.txt)>>> code <<<endpython>>>.
                      Steps in the Development Cycle:

                      Directory Creation Using PowerShell:
                      Objective: Based on insights derived from the chat history, create the necessary directories.
                      Example: <<<shell>>> mkdir modules <<<endshell>>>.
                      Dependency Management:
                      Objective: Download and install all required dependencies to ensure the environment is set up for development.
                      Example: <<<shell>>> pip install requests flask <<<endshell>>>.
                      Directory Navigation:
                      Objective: Use logical reasoning to move between different project folders, facilitating an organized development process.
                      Example: <<<shell>>> cd modules <<<endshell>>>.
                      Module Development:
                      Objective: Provide Python code for modules only after navigating to their respective directories to maintain workflow coherence.
                      Instructions: Implement this step after confirming the directory switch in the previous step.
                      Example Python Code: <<<python (src/module.py)>>> print("Module initialized") <<<endpython>>>.
                      Guidelines:
                      Take these pointers into serious consideration: 
                        Ensure that each step is executed in sequence to maintain the integrity of the development environment.

                        Make sure that you provide COMPLETE and well documented code for all files that you provide. 
                        Make sure you also install all the packages/libraries/toolkits required to run the script.
                        Under any circumstances, DO NOT MESS UP THE DELIMITERS
                        The directories you will give should be relative to the project root directory

                          then you should give "<<<python (src/module.py)>>>" as a starting delimiter
